# T.REX ARMS Sidecar Project

The [T.REX ARMS Sidecar Holster](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/trex-arms-sidecar-holster/) is designed to be modular and extendable.  This repository contains resources that should be enough for anyone to design, manufacture, and sell their Sidecar accessories.

## [Spine System](Spine)

The T.REX ARMS Sidecar hinges on its Spine System.  The Sidecar Spine System was developed with open-source capabilities in mind, since the Spine System is a design that combines the best aspects of both rigid and flexible Sidecar-style holsters. It allows rotation on one axis, which provides comfort, but is extremely rigid on all others, for better concealment. Furthermore, the integrated hinge is simpler, sleeker, and far more modular than other existing connector options.

The design is built around as many off-the-shelf tools and parts as possible, both to support end users and other manufacturers. For example, the hinge pin has a diameter of 0.25″ and the hinge teeth are 0.25″ with 0.25″ gaps. Individual Kydex attachments can be made with hand tools, and the Spine also interfaces well with plastic parts, like the [T.REX Raptor Wing](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/sidecar-raptor-wing-attachment/), or certain textiles, like the biothane [T.REX Tourniquet Holder](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/sidecar-tourniquet-attachment/).

Included are some prints showing all the dimensions in the Sidecar Spine standard that our holsters will be held to, and some 3D files of different tools used in holster manufacture.

## Accessories

We have had excellent results printing these accessories using PLA+ filament on FDM printers like the Ender 3, eSUN’s Hard-Tough resin on SLA printers like the Elgoo Mars line, and having them printed in nylon by professional printers like MK Machining.

### [Dual Wield Adapter](DualWieldAdapter)

If you would like to carry and fire two guns whilst jumping through the air, you would need two sidecar holsters connected together with exactly the right amount of separation for pistol optics and exactly the right amount of angle for a quick draw.

### [Extender](Extender)

One of the best ways to expand your Sidecar’s comfort and concealability might be to literally expand its width. A number of users have discovered that extending the distance between the holster and mag carrier can improve comfort and stability for certain body types.

Since there are many different ways in which you might want to do this, we're including three different widths of file type, as well as a few previous versions.

If you make one of these, you will also need an additional pin to assemble it. The Sidecar Spine System will work with almost any 0.25” rod, including standard hinge pins, but you can get extras from us [here](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/sidecar-spine-replacement-hardware/).
